                    <p style="font-family :'Maven Pro', sans-serif;"> This is a glimpse of my world and how I like things to be aesthetically organised because I feel when you like where you are and what you are doing... You are naturally motivated to be better everyday so that you can achieve all your desired goals. 
                    
                    
                    I think all of us need to conciously make an effort towards how we want our surroundings to be... similarly I try to organise my life in ways that keep me motivated. </p>

                        This artwork is really simple but it denotes to me the depths of the ocean and how light still reaches the darkest places if you just keep swimming... Meaning if you just hustle and work hard </p>

I was busy admiring the beauty of the architecture of the famous "Bhool Bhulaiya" in lucknow and it is a sight that will always be an important part of my childhood</p></div>

I belong to a small village in Uttrakhand, a place where the concept of a "road" for transportation reached only in 2020. People there live a happy life even though it is full of hustle and hard work to survive and that has taught that even when you have a lot to worry about don't forget to smile :) </p>
